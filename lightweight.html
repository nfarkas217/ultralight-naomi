        <b>Doodle</b>
      </summary>
      Key Points:
      <ul>
        <li>Draw wherever you are/what you are looking at</li>
        <li>Draw exactly what you see (perspective)</li>
        <li>
          Don't worry too much about framing-- what's important/what you focused
          on will stand out
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with pen/something that can't be erased-- there are no mistakes
        </li>
        <li>
          You can incorporate a time limit if wanted, but also not necessary.
        </li>
        <li>Mostly the point is to draw it all in one go.</li>

        <b>Journal</b>
      </summary>
      Key Points:
      <ul>
        <li>At the beginning include the date, time, and day of the week</li>
        <li>Don't worry about what to write-- nothing is too mundane</li>
        <li>
          Keep small mementos from the day and tape them in or place in pocket
          at the end
        </li>

        An example entry:
        <br />
        <br />
        2/26/24 Monday 8:46pm
        <br />
        Just ate dinner with friend1 and friend2. Been working with them in
        Scully for the past couple of hours. I keep forgetting to go to the
        UStore to get more gum...

        <b>Food Journal</b>
      </summary>
      Key Points:
      <ul>
        <li>Take a picture of your food</li>
        <li>
          Can describe the story around the food-- who made it, who did you eat
          with, what your thoughts are on the food, etc
        </li>
        <li>Can include other things in the photo too, friends included</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/helen_cookies.jpg" width="400" alt="doodle" />
      <br />
      These are some cookies my friend Helen made. They're strawberry cheesecake
      cookies, and were very tasty. They expanded a lot when they were being
      baked and Helen said they were becoming good friends.
