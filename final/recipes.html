          <p id = "nancy"><b>Nancy, Scallion Pancakes</b></p>
          <p><em>Ingredients</em></p>
        </div>
      <ul>
        <em>Dough</em>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cool water</li>
      <br>
      <em>Filling</em>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
      <li>8 to 10 green onions, chopped</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p><em>Steps</em></p>
      <ol>
      <li>Combine the flour and salt in a big bowl. Stir to mix well.</li>
      <li>Slowly drizzle in the hot water while mixing it with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork), until the water is fully absorbed. </li>
      <li>Slowly drizzle in the cool water, continuing to stir until many dough flakes form.</li>
      <li>Press the dough together, and try to combine the wet dough with the dry flour. Drizzle in a little extra water if there is any dry flour remaining. <br />
      <li>Knead until a firm ball is formed, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the dough is resting, combine the flour, oil, and salt in a small bowl. Mix until a smooth paste is formed.</li>
      <li>When the dough is done resting, knead for another minute until it is smooth. Cut the dough into 6 even pieces, about 76 grams per piece. Form the dough into balls using your hands.</li>
      <li>Work on one dough ball at a time, covering the rest with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Roll each dough ball into a thin rectangle with a rolling pin, aiming for around 6×10” (15×25 cm). </li>
      <li>Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the dough and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon, leaving about 1” (2.5 cm) on top and the left end without the filling. Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons of green onions onto the paste</li>
      <li>Begin rolling the dough from the longer side of the dough where the green onions are concentrated, until you have one long tube. Lightly flatten the tube using your hand. Pinch the side with more green onion to seal it. Take the sealed side and gently pull and roll it towards the unsealed side, using your hand to smooth out the dough to push any large air bubbles out. Tuck the loose end under the rolled bun. Gently press down on the round disk with your hand to seal the pancake.</li>
        <li>Set the formed pancake aside and cover it with plastic wrap. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until each pancake is ready.</li>
        <li>Roll each prepared pancake into a circle, about 7-8” (17-20 cm) wide. Flip and move it as you do to prevent sticking</li>
        <li>Heat a 9” (23 cm) cast iron pan (or a nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat and add enough oil to fully coat the bottom. Once the oil is hot, add a pancake. Use a pair of chopsticks (or a spatula) to swirl the pancake around to spread the oil and prevent sticking, for a few seconds. Cover the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Let the pancake cook, covered, for 1 minute. Remove the lid and flip the pancake, cover, and cook for another minute. </li>
        <li>Cook until pancake is golden brown on both sides. Repeat for all the pancakes</li>
    </ol>
      <p><em>Enjoy</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Remove from the oven and cut into 6 pieces</li>
      <li>Add salt to taste</li>

      <p id = "helen"><b>Helen, Mango Mochi</b></p>
      <p><em>Ingredients</em></p>
    </div>
  <ul>
  <li>mango puree</li>
  <li>sugar</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>glutinous rice flout</li>
  <li>fresh mango</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Steps</em></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Add the mangoes to large bowl and mash until there are no longer any large chunks.</li>
  <li>Add the sugar, pinch of salt, and water into the mango puree. Mix well before adding in the glutinous rice flour.</li>
  <li>Once there are no signs of dry flour. Cover your bowl with a microwave safe cover. 1Microwave for 1 minute</li>
  <li>After 1 minute, carefully mix the mango mochi mixture. After microwaving, mix the mochi mixture again.</li>
  <li>Cover the bowl and microwave for 1 minute again. The dough should be sticky and stretchy, but not wet.</li>
  <li>allow the mochi to cool for 30 minutes in a refrigerator. It’ll thicken as it cools and will be a lot easier to work with.</li>
  <li>Dust your flat surface with a generous amount of corn starch. This will prevent the mochi from sticking. Add in the mochi to the corn starch and sprinkle on some corn starch on the top as well. </li>
  <li>Lightly flatten the ball of mochi until around 0.5-inch (1.25 cm) thick. You can do this with your hands and dust with additional corn starch as needed.</li>
  <li>Get a piece, carefully flatten it more to stretch. Place the mochi wrapper on your palm. Add a chunk of mango in the centre and bring the edges together. From there, pinch the sides together to seal the mochi well.</li>
