      <b>In a Place</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span> Reminders of </span>
      days
      <span> in the past– lights that </span>
      haphazardly
      <span>criss cross around the door, occasionally </span>
      escaping
      <span
        >the bonds of tape that constrain them. They’re a golden yellow at
      </span>
      night
      <span
        >but with the sun coming through the wall-length windows they’re reduced
        to copper wire. Paper cranes hang from the ceiling, multi-colored and
        multi-patterned, flying around in a circle all following one another. I
        sit on a wooden bench--
      </span>
      I imagine
      <span>
        it oak– which hasn’t quite lost its shine but still boldly shows the
        signs of
      </span>
      strain
      <span> – of ours </span>
      released
      <span>
        . Silverware clinks in bowls, the bowls rattle on the countertops, the
        sink turns on
      </span>
      like a sudden rainstorm, lulling
      <span> the </span>
      sounds
      <span> of people </span>
      into
      <span> sounds of the things of people. I find comforn in the </span>
      silence
      <span> of knowing I'm not alone. </span>
