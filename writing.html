    <h1>Dear Vincent, a poem</h1>
    <p>
        When I hear your name,
        <br>
        I see yellow, blues but mostly
        <br>
        Yellow, not the artificial kind but
        <br>
        The one that charms,
        <br>
        That ladies wear, that dashes through the sky
        <br>
        When the crickets come out,
        <br>
        That splays across prickling cornfields
        <br>
        Like a carpet flush across the arid plain.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I close my eyes on tired days <br>
        And I see you,<br>
        Standing in front of a canvas like a <br>
        Jockey stands before an <br>
        Unbroken mare, you have your sleeves rolled up and <br>
        Straw hat pulled low, firmly gripping brush and <br>
        Slashing, twisting and pulling on the taut fabric   <br>                                                 
        With your unharbored insanity, pellets of paint staining <br>
        Your freckled arms, your nose, <br>
        The air thick with the yellow fumes of your <br>
        Feverish lust. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What was inside of your <br>
        Soul, Vincent &mdash; <br>
        Was it fire or <br> 
        Ice? <br>
        Both can burn, you know <br>
        Both can sear the flesh from bone and crumbling marrow &mdash; <br>
        Turn fractured glass into a mirage of the human heart.  <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        What was it like, Vincent, <br>
        To not know the slopes, the crooked angles <br>
        Of your own body and soul, <br>
        To be attacked by a sharp-toothed monster nestled <br>
        Deep inside your heart &mdash; <br>
        Was it frightening, when <br>
        It ate you? <br>
        Did you feel its gnashing teeth, its caustic breath, <br>
        Tearing your limbs into some contorted dance <br>
        At the mercy of a satanic puppet-master <br>
        With all the leisure in the world? <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What were you thinking, Vincent, <br>
        When you pressed the silver blade to your ear &mdash; <br>
        Were your hands shaking, were they sweating? <br>
        Did you scream, thrash about like a fish slick from <br>
        A crescent fall of crimson river-water, <br>
        Or did you stare, uninterested, as you worked your way <br>
        Around the pink, exposed flesh, the mutilated cartilage, <br>
        Hands steady, with all the precision in the world? <br>
        A human is not a canvas, Vincent. <br>
        He cannot be molded, altered, changed to fit a purpose. <br>
        You forgot &mdash; temporarily, dear &mdash; that your <br>
        Skill lies in brushes and pots, <br>
        Not sculpture. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You know, Vincent, <br>
        Someone once said to me that <br>
        Good artists are quite like teacups, <br>
        Fine-boned china men with the fragility of roses &mdash; <br>
        And God, dressed in his Sunday-morning kimono <br>
        Eating a piece of burnt buttered toast &mdash; <br>
        He is the tea-maker.     <br>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Now us, the normal, the average &mdash; <br>
        We get half a cup, rarely more &mdash; <br>
        A fine Grey Earl or strong Japanese herb, if you prefer, <br>
        We are born with the influx of hot liquid into our bowels, <br>
        The dunking of <br>
        Tea leaves on our rims, <br>
        Souls sloshing around in the <br>
        Confines of our porcelain rib-cages. <br>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Our lives are measured in sips between bites of toast <br>
        And the Sunday paper &mdash; <br>
        Life rises in the form of white steam, <br>
        We disappear between God&apos;s lips, <br>
        Drained and gone. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now good artists, now they are of an <br>
        Entirely different kind &mdash; <br>
        God is thirsting for caffeine, for a buzz <br>
        He pours some tea, then more, then more <br>
        Tea and soul and blood mix and spill in a fiery carnage <br>
        A kaleidoscopic outrage <br>
        Liquid splashes down the sides of these fragile glasses <br>
        Overflowing onto saucers, and embroidered dollies. <br>
    </p>


    <p>
        Artists need room, I&apos;m told, they need space &mdash; <br>
        They paint their spilled tea onto the whiteness of a canvas, <br>
        The blankness of a page, <br>
        The yellow gleam of a solitary spotlight <br>
        Spouting their troubles into monologues and dances &mdash; <br>
        A <i>good</i> artist does not do good work, <br>
        A <i>good</i> artist turns himself into the masterpiece. <br>
        He frets over his imperfections, the cracks in his demeanor, <br>
        Wrings the blood out of a washcloth <br>
        And cries himself to sleep at night. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Did your teacup spill, Vincent? <br>
        Did your oolong flow down the sides of your thin china walls&mdash; <br>
        Until you forgot the color of dry? <br>
        That harsh, blinking simplicity, <br>
        Walls too fragile and too glass-like to withstand the <br>
        Imbalance within? <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        How does <i>fire</i> taste, Vincent, <br>
        When you forced the toxic paint down your throat. <br>
        Were you trying to fill yourself with <br>
        Color? Lavish blues and <br>
        Bloody reds, <br>
        Creamy yellows perfect enough to simply <br>
        Melt the soul? <br>
        Were you trying to turn <br>
        Yourself into the art? <br>
        To use the canvas of your <br>
        Intestines, the wraparound pearl <br>
        Of your stomach &mdash; to mix the base pinks of flesh <br>
        With the variegated shades of liquid poison? <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Did it hurt, Vincent? <br>
        When you stepped into the yellow fields, when you <br>
        Pressed the gun to your chest &mdash; <br>
        Did it hurt? <br>
        No, I don&apos;t mean the bullet, <br>
        The shattering of the ribcage into fine dust &mdash; <br>
        What I mean is, <br>
        What did you think, Vincent? <br>
        Did you see Theo&apos;s face, in the sky? <br>
        Did your heart contort and twist itself into <br>
        An indistinguishable blackness, <br>
        A scorching ash, a human vessel with the weight of <br>
        Rusting iron? <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        When I hear your name, Vincent, I see <br>
        Yellow, blues but mostly <br>
        Yellow, I see the sun dripping through oak trees <br>
        In the summer, and honey glistening in a jar <br>
        I see yellow, the kind that charms, <br>
        That full-moon yellow that orbits the land, <br>
        The kind that resides in the bottoms of cornfields &mdash; <br>
        Rises like smoke through the petals of dying suns, <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        And that creases the sky when the crickets come out.
    </p>


    <p>
        I see the yellow that lights a fire and then burns to a <br>
        Crisp &mdash; <br>
        Nighttime coming,
    </p>
    
    <p>Drained and gone.</p>

    <p>
        The yellow that leaves shadows, <br>
        And monsters, when it&apos;s done.
    </p>

    <p>
        Love, <br>
        (And yes, Vincent, there is such a thing <br>
        As love in the world) &mdash; <br>
        Your native beast <br>
    </p>
